## Agentic RAG Architecture:

### 1. Dynamic Query Planning
- **Multiple Retrieval Strategies**: Uses different search methods (keyword, semantic, hybrid) based on query type
- **Iterative Refinement**: Rewrites and refines queries based on initial results
- **Sub-Question Decomposition**: Breaks down complex questions into simpler sub-questions

### 2. Multi-Agent System
```javascript
// Example of how an agentic system might be structured
const agents = {
  planner: new Agent("Plan the analysis approach"),
  researcher: new Agent("Retrieve relevant information"),
  analyst: new Agent("Analyze financial data"),
  validator: new Agent("Verify accuracy and completeness"),
  formatter: new Agent("Format the final output")
};
```

### 3. Self-Reflection and Correction
- Validates its own outputs
- Detects and corrects mistakes
- Identifies knowledge gaps and requests clarification

### 4. Tool Augmentation
- Can use external tools (calculators, web search, APIs)
- Dynamically decides when and how to use tools
- Integrates multiple data sources

### 5. Conversational Memory
- Maintains context across multiple turns
- References previous interactions
- Adapts responses based on conversation history

## Key Differences:

| Feature | Current RAG | Agentic RAG |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Processing** | Single-pass | Multi-step, iterative |
| **Retrieval** | Static similarity search | Dynamic, multi-strategy |
| **Reasoning** | Direct generation | Chain-of-thought, self-reflection |
| **Tools** | None | Can use external tools/APIs |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed behavior | Learns from interactions |
| **Error Handling** | Basic error catching | Self-correcting |
